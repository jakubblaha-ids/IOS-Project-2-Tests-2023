# IOS-Project-2-Tests-2023

**PR's are welcome!**

Run in a directory with your compiled executable:

```
python3 test.py proj2 100 10 1000 100 1000 
```

### ... but I only wanna check the logs!

Run with `--no-exec`. Your project binary execution will be skipped, BUT make sure to still supply the correct arguments! (Yes, the binary name is still required.)

```
python3 test.py --no-exec proj2 100 10 1000 100 1000 
```

Example output:
